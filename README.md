# Cornhole Game (Python / Pygame)

## Description
This project implements a  2D Cornhole game using Python and the Pygame library. 
The player can aim and throw a bean bag toward a tilted cornhole board. 
The bag follows projectile motion with gravity and can slide along the board after landing.

The goal is to land the bag on the board or into the hole.

Scoring
- 3 points – Bag goes into the hole  
- 1 point – Bag lands and stops on the board  
- 0 points – Bag misses the board  

The board is drawn at an angle to resemble a real cornhole board, and the bag may slide toward the hole
depending on where it lands.

# Requirements

This project was developed using Python 3.12.12

It also requires the Pygame library.
